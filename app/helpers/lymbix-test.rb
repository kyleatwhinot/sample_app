puts lymbix.tonalize("Hello.  I do plan on making another ASK today or tomorrow.  Its the same ASK Ive been asking all week.  Ive been targeting different people to share our video on their social media, primarily Facebook page.  I did plan to make an ASK yesterday and I did.  It went well.  Ive had some asks about asking about sharing a video and the person agreed to.  They didnt do it yet so I did ASK them again today and they werent sure how to do it.  So I have a call with them either later or its going to have to be tomorrow, so that I can show them how to share the video with their community. I learned that I shouldnt be so nervous to ASK people to do something like this because it really doesnt take a lot of time or effort on their part and also just about my thought process of thinking, Why would they want to help or why would they want to share it or do anything like that for me?  So its helping me to build confidence I suppose.  Its something small, but I think that its good for me to start small so that I build up a lot of confidence when I actually go to ASK for something that I see as maybe a bigger ASK than this. The struggles I guess are the same.  Its probably just more about my confidence level and people thinking maybe what Im asking them to do is not worthy of their time or maybe they just dont see the point or maybe you have to even think its not a good idea or stupid.  Thats about it.  Bye-bye.")
